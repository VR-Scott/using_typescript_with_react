Typescript:

tsconfig.json:

//** any subdirs
"include": [**/*.ts]
//any .ts in dir and or sub dirs

Starting a simple typescript project:
-use npm init to sett up package.json
-open with vscode, open vsc term,

Dependencies

npm i -D typescript
npm i -D nodemon
npm i -D concurrently

//Install typescript and nodemon as dependencies.

-npx tsc --init
//creates a tsconfig.json

In package.json
"scripts": {
    "build" : "tsc"
  }
then you run:
npm run build
then you run:
node dist/index.js

npx nodemon -w dist -q dist/index.js
//watches dist dir for changes then restarts
//-w watch -q quite mode

//nodemon checks for the changes in the .js not the.ts

npx concurrently "tsc -w" "nodemon -w dist -q dist/index.js"
//runs both concurrently
